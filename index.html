            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        </center>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my first about me page! As you know from the heading, my name is Aryan! I am a student currently at <a href="http://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> learning to code. I am doing their Full Stack Flex course, which is their part time course for those who have jobs such as myself.</p>
        <p>I currently work in retail and to be honest, its not my ideal job. Ideally, I really want implement my own designs and to create websites for my future clients. I currently build websites using <a href="wix.com" target="_blank">Wix.com</a>. Here is one of the site I've built so far &#x2192; <a href="https://www.inglewoodexpresswash.com/">Inglewood Express Carwash</a>.</p>
        <p>I am also learning about Amazon Web Services or AWS, so that I can get certified as a cloud developer as well, and have an easier time whe it comes to get hired.I also have my Certification as a Scrum Master, or in layman's terms a Project Manager for the tech world.</p>

            <h2>More about me</h2>
        </center>
        <h3>Where am I from?</h3>
        <p>I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I would love to move to another state if I can. I would like to live in either Austin, Texas or Seattle, Washington.</p>
        <h3>What is my Dream Job?</h3>
        <p>One of the reason I'm learning to code is because I want to be able to put my own ideas into practice. My dream "Job" would be to code remotely and have the freedom of traveling while doing so. Coding by the beach in the summer time, doesn't that just sound nice? </p>
        <h3>What music have you been listening to?</h3>
        <p>I just found out that my favorite artist, The Weeknd just released a song with a french artist named Gesaffelstein. The song is called: "Lost in the Fire" &#128293; <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZGDGdRIxvd0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
